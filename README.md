# Detangle you jQuery



## Further Exploration

Here are a couple ideas to take the code in this tutorial a step or two
further:

- jQuery has its own template functions, use that instead of inline html as a
  string
- the divs in index.html that hold the examples all have a class of
  'span4'. Visit the [CoffeeScript][coffeescript] site and learn about list
  comprehensions to write a loop that creates the views. How does that
  compare to the `.each` function that comes with jQuery? Which would
  you prefer to use.
- If the requirements continue to grow and it seems we need a more
  complete solution, how simple would it be to convert the existing class into a
  Backbone.View class? Hint: `window.RowViewWithBinding extends
  Backbone.View`
